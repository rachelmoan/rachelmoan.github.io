  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Multi-robot motion planning (MRMP) is a computationally
challenging problem with many applications including
factory automation and search and rescue operations. In this
problem, robots must find safe trajectories from their starts to
their goals while obeying dynamic constraints. Many MRMP
planners are too slow, prone to deadlock, or ignore dynamic
constraints. Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is a discrete version
of the problem which treats robots as points moving on a grid.
In this work, we combine an experience-based MAPF algorithm
with Model Predictive Control (MPC) to quickly reroute robots
while obeying dynamics. We demonstrate preliminary results on
a swapping problem in which several robots must trade places,
and show that our method finds solutions where others fail
